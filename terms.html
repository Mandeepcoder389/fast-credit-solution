          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions ("<strong>Terms</strong>") form a legally binding agreement between you ("<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>your</strong>", or "<strong>User</strong>") and FastCredit Solutions ("<strong>FastCredit</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>"). They govern your access to and use of our website, applications, tools, products and services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"). By accessing or using the Service you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Applicant:</strong> any person who submits an application for a loan or seeks information through the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Partner Lender:</strong> any bank, NBFC, financial institution or other third party that receives application information from FastCredit to evaluate or process loan requests.</li>
            <li><strong>KYC:</strong> Know Your Customer documents required to verify identity and address as per applicable law.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Our Role</h2>
          <p>FastCredit acts as a technology platform and facilitator that helps users discover loan products and connect with partner lenders. We do NOT provide loans ourselves. All loan disbursals, interest rates, fees, approvals and credit decisions are made solely by the relevant partner lender in accordance with their policies and applicable laws.</p>

          <h2>4. Eligibility &amp; Representations</h2>
          <p>By using the Service you represent and warrant that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into contracts;</li>
            <li>You will provide true, accurate, current and complete information when using the Service; and</li>
            <li>You will promptly update any information you provide to keep it accurate and complete.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Application Process</h2>
          <p>When you submit an application via FastCredit:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>We forward the information you provide to partner lenders for evaluation and offers.</li>
            <li>Partner lenders may perform identity, credit, income and fraud checks and may request additional documentation.</li>
            <li>You may receive one or more loan offers; final loan terms are provided by the lender and require your acceptance.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>6. KYC, Documentation &amp; Verification</h2>
          <p>To process loan requests, partner lenders require KYC and supporting documents (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN, salary slips, bank statements). You consent to FastCredit and its partners collecting and verifying such documents. Failure to provide requested documentation may lead to application rejection.</p>

          <h2>7. Fees, Charges &amp; Taxes</h2>
          <p>FastCredit may display indicative fees and processing charges. The exact processing fees, interest rates, prepayment charges, GST and other taxes are determined by the partner lender and will be disclosed in your loan agreement. You are responsible for paying any taxes applicable to your transactions.</p>

          <h2>8. Interest Rates &amp; EMI</h2>
          <p>Interest rates and EMI calculations displayed on the Site are indicative and for informational purposes only. The lender will calculate the final interest and EMI based on their policies. EMI calculators approximate monthly repayment amounts and do not constitute a loan offer.</p>

          <h2>9. Disbursement &amp; Repayment</h2>
          <p>Funds (if approved) are disbursed by the lender directly to your nominated bank account. Repayments must be made to the lender as per the loan agreement. FastCredit bears no responsibility for repayment failures, defaults, or disputes arising between you and the lender regarding repayment.</p>

          <h2>10. Default, Recovery &amp; Reporting</h2>
          <p>Default, late payment and recovery actions are governed by the lender's policies and applicable law. Lenders may report defaults to credit bureaus and exercise their legal rights. FastCredit does not control lender recovery practices.</p>

          <h2>11. Refunds &amp; Chargebacks</h2>
          <p>If you are charged any amount in error by a partner lender, you must raise the discrepancy with the lender in writing. FastCredit will assist in facilitating communication but is not responsible for refund decisions made by the lender.</p>

          <h2>12. User Conduct</h2>
          <p>You must not use the Service for unlawful activities, fraud, misrepresentation, or posting false information. We may suspend or terminate access to the Service for violations, suspicious behavior or if required by law.</p>
